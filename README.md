# Manage Your Bills
A simple desktop app, made using Blazor Server and Electron, to manage and keep track of your bills.

**Download for windows**: You can find the installation file in the assets of this [release](https://github.com/spyroskatsios/ManageYourBills/releases/tag/v1.0.0) or you can just downloaded it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Oq89omVP2-mLTGUgTTv-LtRjrriodfa/view?usp=sharing).

**Usage:**

First, you need to add some providers, from the "Providers" window. There you can also update delete, archiveand unarchive a provider. An archive provider
 will still appear in your providers table, but not in the dropdown in the form for creating a new bill:

You can also add bills from a file, in case you want to add some previous bills and manually adding one by one from the app it's a lot of trouble:
